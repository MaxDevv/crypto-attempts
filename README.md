# Crypto Attempts

    Just toying around :D

## Overview
This repository contains my personal experiments and explorations in cryptocurrency trading, specifically focusing on AI-driven approaches and grid trading models.

## Project Description
This is a playground where I'm tinkering with various crypto trading concepts:

- **Grid Trading Models**: Implementing simple grid trading strategies that place buy and sell orders at predetermined intervals (grids) to capitalize on market volatility
- **AI Integration**: Experimenting with machine learning models to predict price movements and optimize trading parameters
- **Data Analysis**: Playing with historical crypto data to identify patterns and test trading hypotheses

## Purpose
This project is purely educational and experimental. I'm using it to:
- Learn more about algorithmic trading concepts
- Understand the practical applications of AI in financial markets
- Test ideas in a controlled environment before considering real implementations

## Disclaimer
This is not financial advice! These are personal experiments and should not be used for actual trading without thorough validation and risk assessment. I'm just having fun exploring the intersection of cryptocurrency and technology.

## Status
This project is in continuous development as I explore new ideas and approaches. Code quality may vary as this is primarily a learning sandbox.
